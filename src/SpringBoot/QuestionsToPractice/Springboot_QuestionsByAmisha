4. JDBC , What is the difference between Statement and PreparedStatement in JDBC?
-Statement is used for executing static SQL queries. PreparedStatement is used for executing precompiled
     SQL queries with parameters, providing better performance and security against SQL injection.

7. ##Circular Dependency - how to break
-Here are different ways to handle circular dependencies:

 Using @Lazy Annotation-    When ServiceA is being initialized, Spring injects a proxy instance of ServiceB
                            because of the @Lazy annotation.This proxy instance will delegate calls to the actual ServiceB instance once
                            it is fully initialized.

 Setter Injection-  Spring first creates instances of ServiceA and ServiceB without injecting any dependencies.
                    After the bean instances are created, Spring performs dependency injection through the
                    setter methods.

 Field Injection-   Similar to setter injection, Spring first creates the instances of ServiceA and ServiceB
                    without injecting any dependencies.After the bean instances are created, Spring injects dependencies directly
                    into the fields.This ensures that both beans exist before their dependencies are injected, thus breaking the
                    circular dependency.

 Using ObjectFactory or Provider-  ServiceB can get an instance of ServiceA by calling
                                   serviceAFactory.getObject().This lazy resolution of dependencies ensures that the actual instances are
                                   created and injected only when needed, breaking the circular dependency.

10. How to use Actuator in spring Application
-/actuator/health: Shows the health status of the application.
 /actuator/info: Displays arbitrary application info.
 /actuator/metrics: Shows metrics information.
 /actuator/env: Displays environment properties.
 /actuator/beans: Shows a list of all beans in the application context.
 http://localhost:8080/actuator/health.

12. HTTP Requests and Annotations
@RequestMapping("/home")

-@GetMapping("/employees")
public List<Employee> getAllEmployees(){
employeeRepository.findAll();
}

@PostMapping("/employees"){
public void CreateEmployee(Employee employee){
employeeRepository.save(employee);
}

//PathVariable - /users?id=1
-@GetMapping("/employees/{id}")
public Employee getEmployeeById(@Pathvariable("id") Long id){
employeeRepository.find(id);
}

//RequestParam - /users/id=1
-@GetMapping("/employees")
public Employee getEmployeeById(@RequestParam("id") Long id){
employeeRepository.find(id);
}

13. ##ResponseEntity with examples
-ResponseEntity in Spring Boot allows you to have full control over the HTTP response, including status codes,
headers, and the body. This enables you to create more robust and informative APIs, which are crucial for
client-server communication in REST ful services.you can return more detailed responses from your controller
methods.

- @GetMapping("employees/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Employee> getEmployeeById(@PathVariable Long id){
    Employee employee = employeeService.findEmployeeById(id);
    if(employee!=null){
    return new ResponseEntity<Employee>(employee,HTTP_STATUS.OK);
    else
    return new ResponseEntity<Employee>(HTTP_STATUS.NOT_FOUND);
    }

- @PostMapping("employees/)"
    public ResponseEntity<String> createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        userService.createUser(user);
        return new ResponseEntity<>("User created successfully", HttpStatus.CREATED);
    }

- @GetMapping("/users/{id}")
  public ResponseEntity<User> getUserWithHeaders(@PathVariable Long id) {
      User user = userService.getUserById(id);
      if (user != null) {
          HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
          headers.add("Custom-Header", "CustomHeaderValue");
          return new ResponseEntity<>(user, headers, HttpStatus.OK);
      } else {
          return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
      }
  }

                                             name = "student_course",
                                             joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
                                             inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id")
                                         )

// Interview 1
Q1. how to instantiate a teacher class and student class if it has a dependency on one another using java
springboot. How to overcome this circular dependency?
Q2. Design Internal structure of HashMap.
Q3. ##Have you used Garbage collector?
Q4. ##Rate Limiter design - that creates connection if it has availabilty and release connection accordingly.

// Interview 2
Q1. Circular Dependency
Q2. ####A prototype class A and you want to inject Singleton class B into A, then what will happen
Q3. ###2 threads are there- 1 will print all odd numbers and other will print all the even no -
so how to print 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 in definite  order.
