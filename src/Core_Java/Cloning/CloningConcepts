Key Concepts

Shallow Copy: The default implementation provided by the Object class's clone() method creates a shallow copy
of the object. In a shallow copy, fields of primitive types are copied, but fields that are references to objects are
not copied. Instead, the references to the objects are copied, so both the original and the clone refer to the
 same object.

Deep Copy: In a deep copy, all objects are recursively copied, meaning that references to other objects are also
copied, not just the references themselves. This is not provided by the default clone() method and must be
implemented manually.

Cloneable Interface: To enable an object to be cloned, the class must implement the Cloneable interface.
This is a marker interface, meaning it does not contain any methods but signals to the clone() method that
it is safe to clone instances of the class.
