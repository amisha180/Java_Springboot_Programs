1. Can you force garbage collection in Java?

Answer: No, you cannot force garbage collection. You can request it using System.gc(), but the JVM is free to
ignore this request. The garbage collector runs at its own discretion based on the JVM's garbage collection
algorithm and current memory usage.

2. What is a memory leak in Java, and how does it occur?

Answer: A memory leak in Java occurs when objects that are no longer needed by the application are not garbage
collected because they are still reachable through references. This can happen if references to these objects
 are held unintentionally, such as in static fields, long-lived collections, or circular references.

3.What is the difference between minor and major garbage collection?

 Answer: Minor Garbage Collection: Occurs in the Young Generation and is usually fast. It collects short-lived objects.
 Major Garbage Collection (Full GC): Occurs in the Old Generation and is more comprehensive. It includes a
 stop-the-world event and can be more time-consuming.
