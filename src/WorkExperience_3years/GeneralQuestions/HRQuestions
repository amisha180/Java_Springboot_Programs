1. Describe a challenging problem you faced in your recent projects and how you resolved it.

Example Answer: "One of the biggest challenges I faced was optimizing the Kafka consumer in our Event
 Surveillance system. We noticed that our consumers were running out of memory during peak loads.
 To address this, I implemented backpressure by adjusting the max.poll.records configuration and optimized
 our message processing logic to reduce memory usage. Additionally, I increased the heap size temporarily
  and monitored the JVM to ensure stability. These changes significantly improved the system's performance
  and prevented memory-related outages."

//Spiro - While implementing bulk upload feature , created batch related tables manually because automatically it
was not getting created which was causing error.

2. Can you talk about a time when you had to meet a tight deadline? How did you manage it?

Example Answer: "During the development of a critical feature in the Athena Portal, we had a tight deadline
to integrate the Inventory and Lead microservices. I prioritized tasks, coordinated closely with team members,
and used agile practices to break down the work into manageable sprints. We had daily stand-ups to track
progress and address any blockers immediately. By staying focused and collaborating effectively, we
successfully delivered the feature on time."

//GS - I was assigned 5-6 userstory per sprint , so deadlines were always tight over there , but I prioritized
my tasks and if I am stuck or there is dependency for a particular userstory so I straight away start my next
userstory.

//Spiro - Eliminating 3rd party paygops and created new contract and lead microservices.

3. Tell me about a milestone you achieved in your current or previous role.

Example Answer: "A significant milestone was when we successfully rolled out the refined data processing
 pipeline using refiners in our trading and banking project. I was responsible for configuring the YAML-based
  refiners and ensuring they correctly queried the database, transformed the data, and published it to Kafka
  topics. The successful deployment of this system enhanced data accuracy and improved the overall performance
   of post-trade checks."

// GS - Successfully completed all the user stories assigned to me with.
// Spiro - Eliminating 3rd party paygops and identifying cluster to be decommissioned.

4. How do you handle conflicts or disagreements within your team?

Example Answer: "I believe in addressing conflicts early and openly. In one instance, there was a disagreement
 between team members about the approach to implementing a feature. I facilitated a meeting where everyone
 could express their views and concerns. We discussed the pros and cons of each approach and eventually
 reached a consensus by focusing on the project's objectives. By fostering open communication and mutual
  respect, we were able to resolve the conflict and move forward as a team."

   smaller, manageable parts and tackle them based on their urgency and importance. Regular check-ins with
    my manager and team help ensure that I'm aligned with project goals and can adjust priorities if needed."


8. Can you give an example of a time you made a mistake at work and how you handled it?

Example Answer: "In one of my earlier projects, I missed an edge case in a SQL query that led to incorrect
data being processed by the refiner. Once I realized the mistake, I immediately informed my team and took
 responsibility. I quickly fixed the query, ran additional tests to ensure all cases were covered, and
 implemented a more rigorous review process to prevent similar issues in the future. The experience taught
  me the importance of thorough testing and double-checking my work."

//GS - while creating refiners , wrong configuration - fixed it by logs.
//Spiro - Handled duplicate and all other edge cases

9. What has been your greatest achievement in your current role?

Example Answer: "My greatest achievement was leading the migration of our data processing system to a

14. Tell me about a time when you had to explain a complex technical concept to a non-technical stakeholder.

Example Answer: "While working on the Event Surveillance system, I had to explain the benefits of using Kafka
for data streaming to a non-technical stakeholder. I broke down the concept by comparing Kafka's message
queuing system to a conveyor belt, where data items are placed on the belt and consumed by different
processes. I highlighted how this approach improves data processing efficiency and scalability, using
simple analogies to ensure they understood the value it brought to the project."


15. What steps do you take to debug a complex issue in production?

Example Answer: "When faced with a complex issue in production, I start by gathering as much information
 as possible, including logs, error messages, and any recent changes to the system. I then try to reproduce
  the issue in a test environment. Once I’ve identified the root cause, I develop a solution, test it
  thoroughly, and apply the fix. After deployment, I monitor the system closely to ensure that the issue is
  fully resolved and that there are no regressions."


16. Have you ever had to take over a project midway through? How did you handle it?

Example Answer: "Yes, I once had to take over a project when a colleague left unexpectedly. The project
 involved configuring refiners for data transformation in our banking project. To get up to speed, I reviewed
 all the existing documentation, analyzed the codebase, and had knowledge transfer sessions with the
  outgoing colleague. I also communicated with the stakeholders to understand their expectations and adjusted
  the project plan to accommodate any changes. This approach allowed me to successfully complete the
  project without delays."


17. What strategies do you use to manage stress during high-pressure situations?

Example Answer: "During high-pressure situations, I stay focused by breaking down the tasks into smaller,
 manageable pieces and tackling them one at a time. I prioritize my work, eliminate distractions, and
 make sure to take short breaks to avoid burnout. I also practice deep breathing exercises to stay calm
 and maintain clarity in decision-making. Additionally, I remind myself of past successes in overcoming
